# Lab 1: Practice with Haskell

In this lab, you will practice writing functions in Haskell.

First, pull my repository into your local repository, using either the command line, TortoiseGit or Git Extensions.

* In the command prompt (Git Bash), type in the following:

		cd COMP501 # Go into your course folder
		git pull upstream master # Merge this lab into your local repository.

* In TortoiseGit, navigate to your course repository. You can get to it by opening the Desktop folder, clicking on your name, and then selecting the COMP501 folder. Once there, right click inside the folder (but not on any particular file), click **TortoiseGit -> Pull...**. For the Remote, select upstream and click OK.

* In Git Extensions, open the COMP501 repository, and click on Pull (the down arrow). For the Remote, select upstream and click Pull.

Second, open Lab1.hs, and practice with the functions you see there.

Finally, don't forget to commit and push your work using either the command line, TortoiseGit or Git Extensions. It's a good habit to commit and push frequently.

* In the command prompt (Git Bash), type in the following:

		git commit -am "Finished Lab 1" # Record your changes into a commit
		git push --all origin # Toss it over to your remote private repository

* In TortoiseGit, navigate to your course repository. You can get to it by opening the Desktop folder, clicking on your name, and then selecting the COMP501 folder. Once there, right click inside the folder (but not on any particular file), click **Git Commit... -> "master"**. Enter your message (e.g., "Finished Lab 1" or "Work in progress" or even "Stupid code won't compile. What's wrong?"), and make sure Lab1.hs is checked. Then click OK. Click Push... when TortoiseGit says you committed successfully, select origin for your remote, and click OK.

* In Git Extensions, in your COMP501 repository, and click on Commit (the red circle with a checkmark), click on Lab1.hs, click the downward purple arrow (Stage), and enter your commit message (e.g., "Finished Lab 1" or "Work in progress" or even "Stupid code won't compile. What's wrong?"). Click Commit & push.
