# Lab 1: Practice with Haskell

In this lab, you will practice writing functions in Haskell.

First, pull my repository into your local repository, using either the command line, TortoiseGit or Git Extensions.

* In the command prompt (Git Bash), type in the following:

	cd COMP501 # Go into your course folder
	git pull upstream master # Merge this lab into your local repository.

* In TortoiseGit, navigate to your course repository. You can get to it by opening the Desktop folder, clicking on your name, and then selecting the COMP501 folder. Once there, right click inside the folder (but not on any particular file), click **TortoiseGit -> Pull...**. For the Remote, select upstream and click OK.

* In Git Extensions, open the COMP501 repository, and click on Pull (the down arrow). For the Remote, select upstream and click Pull.

Open Lab1.hs, and practice with the functions you see there.
